# API Lifecycle Framework - Intro Discussion

July 13, 2020: Day 1 of the CMS API Summit 2020

We will form groups automatically using Zoom's breakout feature. Part of the goal is to meet and share with new people, so don't worry if no one else from your usual team is in your group.

Once in your group:

Introduce yourselves. What API(s) do you work on? What is your role? Give a little background on your API: Who is the user for your API? What problem does your API solve? Have you launched to production yet?

As a group, discuss and complete the questions in the  [Google form](https://forms.gle/kwFrKqhh8cxm6Meo6): 
https://forms.gle/kwFrKqhh8cxm6Meo6 

This form will be used to start building out materials and a roadmap for the API community at CMS, but it is also intended as a conversation starter for your group. If the conversation gets good, let it flow and don't worry too much about finishing all the questions. Just don't forget to submit the form with what you have at the end!

At 11:50 we will reconvene as a large group and share highlights from our breakout discussions.

Tips: 
* It might be helpful to designate one person as the typer. 
* Try going around the circle for everyone to take turns answering each question if conversation is a bit slow-starting. 
* The form is anonymous, but if you want to share who was in the group or what APIs were discuessed, feel free to include that info in the final question.
* In Zoom, you can ask the facilitator for assistance while inbreakout rooms. If you need me, use this feature to let me know and I will join your room.
