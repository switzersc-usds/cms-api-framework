# Birds of a Feather: Developing Shared Best Practices

July 15, 2020: Day 3 of the CMS API Summit 2020

We will form groups using Zoom's breakout feature. We are organizing into 4 topic-based groups:

1. API strategy, policy, and user research. Leads: Caroline Smith, Denise St Clair
2. API design: REST, GraphQL, SOAP, and more. Lead: Shelby Switzer
3. API testing, monitoring, and security. Lead: Gina Maini
4. API discovery, promotion, and change management. Lead: Anshul Kumar

You can choose which group you'd like to participate in. Let us know beforehand which group by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/8oYAMx3oemWTiSZA6). 

It may take a few minutes to get everyone in the right group, so please be patient with us and don't step away for a break until you're in the group you want to be in.

**Once in your group:**

Quick round of intros: Who you are, what you work on, and why you're intersted in this topic.

Next, use the following discussion guides for your group. The leader or designated note taker in the group will record answers and submit notes to me at shelby.switzer@cms.hhs.gov at the end of the session.
