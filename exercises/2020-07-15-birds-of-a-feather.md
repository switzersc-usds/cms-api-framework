Birds of a Feather: Developing Shared Best Practices

July 15, 2020: Day 3 of the CMS API Summit 2020

We will form groups using Zoom's breakout feature. We are organizing into 4 topic-based groups:

1. API strategy, policy, and user research. Leads: Caroline Smith, Denise St Clair
2. API design: REST, GraphQL, SOAP, and more. Lead: Shelby Switzer
3. API testing, monitoring, and security. Lead: Gina Maini
4. API discovery, promotion, and change management. Lead: Anshul Kumar

You can choose which group you'd like to participate in. It may take a few minutes to get everyone in the right group, so please be patient with us and don't step away for a break until you're in the group you want to be in.

Once in your group:

Quick round of intros: Who you are, what you work on, and why you're intersted in this topic.
