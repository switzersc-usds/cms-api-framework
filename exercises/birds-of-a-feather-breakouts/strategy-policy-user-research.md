# Breakout: API Strategy, Policy, and User Research

## Key questions
Taking from the [API Lifecycle Framework](https://github.com/switzersc-usds/cms-api-framework/blob/master/api-lifecycle-framework.md), some key questions related to strategy include:

* What is the problem(s) we are trying to solve? 
* Whose problem is it? Are they the same as our user? If not, what is our user's problem?
* Why would someone want to use our API?
* How are users involved in the product roadmapping and development process?
* How do we measure impact and success?
* When does strategy change?

What other key questions should API teams at CMS be asking as they develop their API strategy? 

## The policy lens
As a governmental agency, much of the work we do is driven by policy. How do you experience policy informing API strategy, and API strategy informing policy? How does user research feed into either?

## What's working
What's working well on your teams with regard to strategy, policy, and user research?

## What's not working
What's not working so well on your teams with regard to strategy, policy, and user research? What could be improved?

## Shared best practices and values
As a group, identify and agree upon three practices or shared values you think all API teams at CMS should follow regarding strategy, policy, and user research. 

If you can all agree on more than 3, go for it!
