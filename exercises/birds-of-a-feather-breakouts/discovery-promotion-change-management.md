# Breakout: API Discovery, Promotion, and Change Management

## Key questions
Taking from the [API Lifecycle Framework](https://github.com/switzersc-usds/cms-api-framework/blob/master/api-lifecycle-framework.md), some key questions related to discovery, promotion, and change management include:

* Are my users internal or external?
* How do my users find out about my API?
* What are my usage goals?
* Who owns the discovery experience and how will it be maintained?
* What changes are considered breaking?
* How long do we want to or can we maintain previous versions?
* How do we communicate changes with our users? How do we measure the success of this communimcation?
* What versioning strategy do we want to use and how is this documented?
