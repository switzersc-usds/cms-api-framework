# Breakout: API Design: REST, GraphQL, SOAP, etc

## Key questions
Taking from the [API Lifecycle Framework](https://github.com/switzersc-usds/cms-api-framework/blob/master/api-lifecycle-framework.md), some key questions related to API design include:

* What is the learning curve for my users when they onboard to my API?
* Does the API resource model make sense to my users?
* Is my design continuously informed by user feedback?
* Am I using and complying with open standards and conventions such as JSON, FHIR, or HTTP status codes?
* What kind of architectural approach makes sense for solving the problem identified in my API strategy? E.g. REST, GraphQL, etc.
